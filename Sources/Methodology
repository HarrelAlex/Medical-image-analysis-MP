## Methodology

CAD is fundamentally based on highly complex pattern recognition. X-ray or other types of images are scanned for suspicious structures. 
Normally a few thousand images are required to optimize the algorithm. 
Digital image data are copied to a CAD server in a DICOM-format and are prepared and analyzed in several steps.

## 1. Preprocessing for

Reduction of artifacts (bugs in images)
Image noise reduction
Leveling (harmonization) of image quality (increased contrast) for clearing the image's different basic conditions e.g. different exposure parameter.
Filtering

## 2. Segmentation for

Differentiation of different structures in the image, e.g. heart, lung, ribcage, blood vessels, possible round lesions
Matching with anatomic databank
Sample gray-values in volume of interest[15]

## 3. Structure/ROI (Region of Interest) Analyze Every detected region is analyzed individually for special characteristics:

Compactness
Form, size and location
Reference to close by structures / ROIs
Average grey level value analyze within a ROI
Proportion of grey levels to border of the structure inside the ROI

## 4. Evaluation / classification After the structure is analyzed, every ROI is evaluated individually (scoring) for the probability of a TP. 
The following procedures are examples of classification algorithms.

Nearest-Neighbor Rule (e.g. k-nearest neighbors)[16]
Minimum distance classifier
Cascade classifier
Naive Bayes classifier
Artificial neural network[17][18][19][20][21]
Radial basis function network (RBF)
Support vector machine (SVM)[22][23]
Principal component analysis (PCA)
If the detected structures have reached a certain threshold level, they are highlighted in the image for the radiologist. 
Depending on the CAD system these markings can be permanently or temporary saved. 
The latter's advantage is that only the markings which are approved by the radiologist are saved. 
False hits should not be saved, because an examination at a later date becomes more difficult then.
